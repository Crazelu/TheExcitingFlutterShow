## Exploring UndoHistoryController and TextEditingController.

In this episode, I show how to take advantage of the `TextEditingController`'s text painting capabilities on a high level to add visual distinction to the texts in `TextField`, `TextFormField` or `EditableText` widgets. For example, this is useful for distinguishing between user tags and other texts in your text field. 

From [Flutter 3.0.0](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/96968), a new `undoController` property can be provided to the `TextField` and `EditableText` widgets. This allows undo/redo operations to be performed on the value of the editable text field. In this episode, I demonstrate how can be used to implement a simple text editing interface with undo and redo actions.
