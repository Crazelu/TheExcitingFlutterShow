# TheExcitingFlutterShow Episode 02

## Keyboard and Text Editing Autocompletion

In this episode, I show how autocompletion can be added to rich editing interfaces built in Flutter using the trie data structure. And with knowledge from [Episode 01](https://github.com/Crazelu/TheExcitingFlutterShow/tree/main/episode), the suggestion is painted with a lower opacity than the main text color.
I also demonstrate how gestures can be used to apply inline suggestions.
