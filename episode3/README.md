## Testing AppLifecycleState Changes in Flutter

One of the ways we get app lifecycle states that tell us whether our Flutter apps are in the foreground, background or inactive, is using `WidgetsBindingObserver` and attaching a callback for `didChangeAppLifecycleState` which would let us know when the `AppLifecycleState` changes.

In this episode, I'll show how behaviours influenced by changes in `AppLifecycleState` can be verified by widget tests in Flutter apps.
